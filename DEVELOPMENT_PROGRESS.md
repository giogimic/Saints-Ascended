## 🛠️ Server Configuration UI Status

### ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE - Server Configuration Fields
The AddServerForm already includes **ALL** required fields:
- [x] Server Name
- [x] Map (dropdown selection with custom map support)
- [x] Executable Path (required)
- [x] Config Directory (required) 
- [x] Server Directory (required)
- [x] Game Port
- [x] Query Port
- [x] RCON Port
- [x] Admin Password
- [x] RCON Password
- [x] Server Password

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Manual Mod Adding Enhancement
**Current Status**: ModManager has single mod adding capability
**Required**: Bulk mod adding with comma-separated IDs (12345,67890,112233)

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **UI Enhancement**: Convert single mod ID input to textarea for bulk input
2. **Parse Function**: Split comma-separated values and validate mod IDs
3. **Batch Processing**: 
   - Check cache for existing mod data
   - Fetch missing mod info from CurseForge API
   - Update SQLite storage with new mod data
   - Refresh UI instantly with mod details
4. **Error Handling**: Individual mod validation with status feedback

**Recommended Implementation**:
```typescript
const processBulkModIds = async (modIdsText: string) => {
  const modIds = modIdsText.split(',').map(id => id.trim()).filter(Boolean);
  // Batch process with cache checking and API fetching
  // Update UI progressively as each mod is processed
};
```
